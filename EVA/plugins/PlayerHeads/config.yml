# PlayerHeads Configuration
# IMPORTANT NOTE: heads dropped by charged creepers are not modified by this plugin nor the below settings.
# Defaults/explanation:
# pkonly: true                  [true/false]    When true trophies only drop when a player kills another player (as opposed to self drowning, etc)
# droprate: 0.05                [0.0 -> 1.0]    Chance that a trophy will drop when a player dies (1 is 100%, 0 is never)
# lootingrate: 0.2              [0.0 -> 1.0]    Increases all droprates by lootingrate percent per looting level when a enchanted weapon is used
# mobpkonly: true               [true/false]    When true mob trophies only drop when a player kills the mob (as opposed to a lava blade or fall death)
# fixcase: true                 [true/false]    When spawning/renaming heads, will attempt to make the input case insensitive
# updatecheck: true             [true/false]    Checks for update on startup and alerts admins
# broadcast: true               [true/false]    Sends a message when someone gets beheaded
# broadcastrange: 0             [positive int]  Radial distance in meters in which other players will hear the broadcast message (0 is unlimited)
# broadcastmob: false           [true/false]    Sends a message when a mob gets beheaded (v5.0 alpha 2+)
# broadcastmobrange: 0          [positive int]  Radial distance in meters in which other players will hear the mob broadcast message (0 is unlimited) (v5.0 alpha 2+)
# antideathchest: false         [true/false]    Do not allow other plugins to fiddle with dropping player heads, makes certain they drop on the ground
# dropboringplayerheads: false  [true/false]    Drop plain heads when a player dies, instead of the player's head
# dropvanillaheads: true        [true/false]    Drop vanilla mob heads whenever possible on death and on breaking head (for creeper/skeleton/zombie/witherskeleton/dragon)  (version 4.1+)
#                                               If this is false, any modified drops and breaking of skulls will use skinned player head versions only.
# convertvanillaheads: false    [true/false]    When false, avoid converting the type head of when its block is broken. 
#                                               When true (or pre-4.2), the head is automatically converted to vanilla or skinned depending on the state of `dropvanillaheads` setting. (version 4.2+)
# nerfdeathspam: false          [true/false]    Don't drop a head when a player has died recently to the same killer (within a threshold). This alleviates some ability to farm heads. (version 4.3+)
#                                               If pkonly is disabled, a player dying repeatedly to any mob is also nerfed similarly under this option.
# addlore: true                 [true/false]    If true (or pre-4.6), add plugin and player/mob lore text to plugin-added head items. If false, skip adding any lore. (version 4.6+)
# clickspamcount: 5             [positive int]  Number of click interactions to record and check for spam  (version 4.7+)
# clickspamthreshold: 1000      [positive int]  Amount of miliseconds to match click interactions for spam  (version 4.7+)
# deathspamamount: 5            [positive int]  Number of player deaths to record and check for spam  (version 4.7+)
# deathspamthreshold: 300000    [positive int]  Amount of miliseconds to match player deaths for spam  (version 4.7+)
# fixdroppedheads: true         [true/false]    Whether or not to update the name,lore on dropped head items (fixes heads broken by pistons/water) (version v4.9+)
#
# requireitem: false            [true/false]    If true, an item in the 'requireditems' list must be held in the main hand to behead. Disabled by default. (v5.0 alpha 3+)
# requireditems: [...]          [list]          A lowercase list of Bukkit Materials that permit beheading when held in the main hand, if 'requireitem' is enabled. By default this includes axes. (v5.0 alpha 3+)
#
# considermobkillers: false     [true/false]    If true, consider Mobs responsible for deaths as "killers" as well. This enables effects 'requireitem' and 'lootingrate' to the mob. Disabled by default. (v5.0 alpha 3+)
# considertameowner: false      [true/false]    If true, consider Tamed mobs (Wolf) attacks to come from their owner. Requires 'considermobkillers' to be enabled. (v5.0 alpha 3+)
#
# chargedcreeperbehavior:ignore [string]        Sets what PlayerHeads will do when a Charged Creeper kills something (only if 'considermobkillers' is enabled). (v5.2+)
#                                                "ignore" allows head drops to be added to existing ones.
#                                                "replace" removes vanilla heads from the death and adds PH head chances.
#                                                "block" removes all head drops from the death only.
#                                                "vanilla" causes the plugin to not modify the drops or apply PH behavior to the death at all.
