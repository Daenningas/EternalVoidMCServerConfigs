# Which method should we use to find a safe location? Since this plugin is meant to work 'out-of-the-box' without need
#   of configuring, the 'auto' option has been included.
# a - Auto:       Chooses middle-out for the nether and top-down for everything else.
# b - Top down:   Starts the search at the high bound and moves down until it finds the ground.
# c - Middle out: Starts the search between high and low and moves up and down to find land.
# The main difference between a and b? Top-down will never spawn you in a cave whereas Middle-out is intended for
#   underground teleports. Middle-out was written specifically to be used in the nether, though you can use it wherever.
# Note: If you choose c, you may want to edit `bounds.high` and make sure it it set to the max height for your world.
