#### rtp-on-first-join
# If enabled, when a new player joins the server, they will be teleported according to the given rtpSettings, and will
#   land in the given world.
## Notes:
# The rtpSettings given for `settings` MUST be set to a valid rtpSettings file defined in the folder `/rtpSettings`.
# The world given for `world` MUST be listed as an `enabled-world` in the given rtpSettings.
rtp-on-first-join:
  enabled: true
  settings: 'default-settings'

#### rtp-on-death
# Should we have players respawn at a random location after dying?
# For a player to be rtp-d on death, the following items must be true:
#   This setting is enabled (`enabled` is set to true)
#   Either the player has no bed to respawn at OR `respect-beds` is set to false.
#   Either the player has the permission `jakesrtp.rtpondeath` OR `require-permission` is set to false.
## Notes:
# The rtpSettings given for `settings` MUST be set to a valid rtpSettings file defined in the folder `/rtpSettings`.
# The world given for `world` MUST be listed as an `enabled-world` in the given rtpSettings.
rtp-on-death:
  enabled: true
  settings: 'default-settings'
  respect-beds: true
  require-permission: false

#### location-cache-filler
# Should we cache RTP locations beforehand?
#   recheck-time      : The amount of time to wait before trying to refill the cache.
#   between-time      : The amount of time to wait between each location search.
#   async-wait-timeout: The amount of time to wait for the completion of an async function (Mostly chunk loading)
## Notes:
# In all three settings, the unit of time is `seconds`.
# Unless you specifically don't want this, it should be enabled as it improves performance like crazy!
# The defaults for this are pretty good, though if you don't use Paper or frequently have people rtp-ing at the same
#   time, then you may want to increase `between-time` up to `1` or `2`.
# MAKE SURE TO USE PAPER! No joke, because of this feature, JakesRTP is about 10x faster on paper than plain spigot.
location-cache-filler:
  enabled: true
  recheck-time: 1800
  between-time: 0
  async-wait-timeout: 10

#### logging
# Which messages do you want to log? You can ignore log messages for settings that are disabled.
#   rtp-on-player-join  : Obvious
#   rtp-on-respawn      : Obvious
#   rtp-on-command      : When a player runs a command on themselves. Ex: `/rtp`
#   rtp-on-force-command: When a player is FORCED to rtp through something like this: `/forcertp Steve`
#   rtp-for-queue       : This logs when a new location is cached. (This is the annoying one that can be turned off)
## Notes:
# Very little for notes here as all this is for is log messages.
logging:
