radius:
  max: 150

gaussian-distribution: # Enabling this will make the points no longer evenly distributed, but instead follow a
  enabled: false       #   gaussian centered between the min and max radius (represented by setting center to
  shrink: 4            #   0 for min, 1 for max, or anything in between). Shrink makes the distribution denser,
  center: 0.25         #   my preference is to keep it near 3 for a center of 0 or 1, and 6 for a center of 0.5
