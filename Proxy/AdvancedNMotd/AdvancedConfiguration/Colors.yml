#Imagine you always forget a code of a color
#you like and always need to look for it somewhere.
#This must be annoying. To prevent this, just
#create a placeholder with its name and mention
#what color should be applied when you use it!
#Like that you can add any color placeholder you want!
#
#Examples:
#1)
#Green_Beige: "#BEBD7F" will create %Green_Beige%
#placeholder which does exactly same thing as %#BEBD7F%
#2)
#Intense_Red_Orange: "#FFB961"
#3)
#exampleColor: "#F0F0F0"
#
#IMPORTANT!
#Custom placeholders CANNOT have
#same names as default ones.
#
#Example:
#maxplayers: "#112233" is a wrong placeholder!
#You cannot use "maxplayers" as a name as there
#is already %maxplayers% placeholder.
#

Placeholders:
    red: "#FF0000"
    crimson: "#DC143C"
    brown: "#A52A2A"
    orange: "#FFA500"
    rosybrown: "#EEB4B4"
    lime: "#C7EA46"
    leaf: "#5A945D"
    olive: "#808000"
    skyblue: "#35A8E4"
    nightsky: "#000F2D"
    daysky: "#4283FF"
    yellow: "#FFFF00"
    green: "#008000"
    blue: "#0000FF"
    darkblue: "#00008B"
    purple: "#800080"
    
#Let a player with old client (< 1.16) view
#your motd (requires ProtocolLib to work if you
#have a spigot server)
Replacements:
    #If a player with a legacy client (< 1.16)
    #views your server's motd change every #CF3476
    #color in it to &5 (if a replacement is not directly
    #written, plugin will automatically find closest
    #color in its opinion).
    "#CF3476": "&5"
